A customizable commandbar created by typicalusername

## Features

- Ability to add custom scripts.
- Easy to use
- Good UI
- Fully customizable


## Uh-Ohs
- It doesn't come with pre-installed modules.

Kinda a bad thing, but it's something I don't wanna waste my time on.

- Unable to remove scripts via the script manager. Only able to fully reset.

I'll work on that later on. A more improved script manager is gonna be added soon. When I mean soon I mean probably never.
## Documentation

bootleg runs off of a single json file located inside of your workspace folder named "BootlegData.json".

It's not very organized and may be hard to read if you're new to this.




## Usage

Execute the loadstring and press ";" to open the bar.

To use scripts, just type in the command (doesn't have to be the full name)

Example: (for Derpz Glitcher : The Final Chapter)
```
derpz

or

derpz glitcher
```

The command bar shows the commands that might match what you're looking for (a feature from the script this is based off of.)

Adding scripts is easy!

Use the command "Add Script" (doesn't have to be full) and it'll show up a script manager.

Just select your script from the list, type in the info, press Add, and Voila!
